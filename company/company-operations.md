# Company Operations

We are incorporated in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (“RMI”) and our corporate governance practices are governed by applicable RMI law, our Restated Articles and bylaws.

We. operate on all aspects of the international shipping industry. Which can be divided into four closely related shipping markets, each trading in a different commodity:&#x20;

the freight market,&#x20;

the sale and purchase market,&#x20;

the newbuilding market and&#x20;

the demolition market.

We have granted, and may continue to grant, stock-based, tokenized awards to Key Employees and Consultants, which will increase our share-based compensation and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

In order to compete for talents, we may need to offer higher compensation to our key and consultants, including granting awards under our current equity incentive plan, which may include the grant of shares of restricted common stocks.&#x20;

We have adopted various equity incentive plans, In addition, we granted a performance-based stock awards to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and director. We believe the granting of stock-based awards is important to our ability to attract and retain key personnel and employees, and we will continue to grant share-based, tokenized awards in the future. As a result, our expenses associated with share-based compensation will increase, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
