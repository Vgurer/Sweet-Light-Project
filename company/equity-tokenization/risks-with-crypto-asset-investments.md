# Risks with Crypto Asset Investments

Investing in a fraction of a real world asset is %100 opposite of investing at crypto. You don't receive "interest" from a real world asset, but "dividend" from the SPAC -sepcial acquisiton company- or   a fraction of the "rent" of the property.

Crypto "assets" held in an interest-bearing account may be used to invest in various crypto asset-related products, schemes or other activities, including lending programs in which the crypto assets are loaned to borrowers. The interest being paid to you is based on these investment activities. These investment activities by the company are subject to the same risks that you are subject to with crypto assets, including:

volatility and illiquidity in the crypto asset markets;&#x20;

the risk that the company holding your crypto assets might fail or go bankrupt;

&#x20;unpredictability, including that the market for a particular crypto asset may disappear altogether or the crypto asset may no longer be tradable anywhere;

changes in regulation by federal, state or foreign governments that may restrict the use and exchange of crypto assets;&#x20;

the inability to be made whole should fraud, default or a mistake occur; and potential fraud, technical glitches, hackers or malware.
