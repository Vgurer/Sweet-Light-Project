# Marshall Islands Taxation

The following are the material Marshall Islands tax consequences of our activities to us and to our stockholders of investing in our Common Stock.&#x20;

Under current Marshall Islands law, we are not subject to tax on income or capital gains, and no Marshall Islands withholding tax or income tax will be imposed upon payments of dividends by us to our stockholders or proceeds from the disposition of our Common Stock, provided such stockholders are not residents in the Marshall Islands.&#x20;

There is no tax treaty between the United States and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.
