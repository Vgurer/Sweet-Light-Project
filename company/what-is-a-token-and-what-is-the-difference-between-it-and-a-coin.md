# What is a token and what is the difference between it and a coin?

Crypto currencies created on an existing blockchain network as opposed to its own blockchain network are called "token"s. For example Btc, Eth and Algo are crypto currencies created on their own blockchain networks named Bitcoin, Ethereum and Algorand respectively, but tokens are crypto currencies created in a certain format on any existing blockchain network like Ethereum, not on its own blockchain network.
