# How the real world asset is tokenized?

In practice, the process of asset tokenization has roughly the following steps:&#x20;

1.Getting actors across the whole asset lifecycle involved to set up the project.&#x20;

2.Creating an onshore SPV / SPAC for the minority shares of the asset. Or, in some other cases for the total ownership of the asset.

3.Tokenize the SPV while assuring the legal contract between the asset owner (majority) and the SPV.&#x20;

4.Setting up compliance rules & legal.&#x20;

5.Creating the project token itself through a software solution.&#x20;

6.Setting up a bank account for the SPV and bridging to blockchain wallet.&#x20;

7.Setting up the payment, trading, and distribution mechanisms on blockchain.&#x20;

8.Enabling automated reporting and corporate actions if needed.
