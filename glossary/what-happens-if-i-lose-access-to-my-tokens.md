# What happens if I lose access to my tokens?

Remember the motto "not youÄ±r key, not your coins"?



If you ever lose your real world asset tokens or are the victim of a hack or phishing attack, you will be able to get those tokens back once Governance 2.0 launches towards the end of 2025.

It will be as easy as calling a vote that your fellow co-owners, DAO memebrs participate in to burn and re-issue the tokens in your project awnership.
