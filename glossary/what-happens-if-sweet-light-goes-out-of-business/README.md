# What Happens If Sweet Light Goes Out Of Business?

Because your tokens represent legal ownership in the DAO LLC that owns each real world asset, you would not lose your investment if the company went out of business.

If we went out of business, each property DAO LLC would continue to remain in existence as a separate legal entity for asset holding, tax, accounting, liability, and member ownership purposes. Regardless of what happens to \_\_\_\_., the assets and the real world asset backed tokens of an DAO LLC would remain independent and intact.

The  tokens would still represent and evidence ownership of the asset(s) contained in the DAO LLC and, as such, could be transferred in the market, as needed, so long as applicable securities transfer rules are complied with.

You, therefore, remain the owner of your tokens. If there is a liquidation of ----- Inc., the DAO members would continue to use the governance program to decide on how to handle the DAO and its asset. This can include electing a full-time managing member within the DAO or the DAO can choose to continue operating in a decentralized manner. The party responsible for processing and serving the governance program will change from -----  to ----- Law LLP.

Owners will recover pro-rata portions of their principle based on the net proceeds after paying for agents, title, and legal fees. Any funds left in the Maintenance Reserves and other Reserves will be disbursed to token holders as well.

Owners would redeem their funds back by sending their tokens to ---- wallet address, which will be managed by the law firm. Once the tokens are received, owners would receive funds credited back to them via ---- or Crypto. If ----  is no longer in business, then we would not be able to purchase the tokens back and provide liquidity, so please be aware of this risk.
