# Where will the real world asset tokens be traded?

Primarily at the project website, but, real world asset tokens are also tradable on partner exchanges. In a DeFi world, dematerialized assets on a decentralized blockchain are digitally subscribed to eligible investors. The Defi Dapps can also enforce the compliance of the onboarded investor and provide an interface for investors and issuers to manage their assets.

The token owners may have many different wallets, but the bridging between chains and migrating to other chains requires heavy back-end programming and has its own risks.

While we are open to DAO suggestions, our teams had (beside ethereum),  avalanche, tezos, polygon, fantom, arbbitrum, algorand type of rollups or acyclic hashgraph chains in mind too.
