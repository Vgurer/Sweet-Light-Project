# Which blockchain is Sweet Light using to tokenize real world asset?

At TGE (Token Genereting Event) we keep our ledger as chain-agnostic as possible.

But, as you see on the roadmap, We'll use multiple chains, including the Fantom, or Algorand blockchain to host our token offerings. They have some advantages over blockchains like Ethereum and Solana:

* Algorand has minimal fees for transfers (only 0.001 ALGO), which is ideal for us to be able to pay you dividend payments once the asset token is fully funded.
* [https://ftmscan.com/gastracker](https://ftmscan.com/gastracker) You can see the Gas & GWEI for fantom network fees.&#x20;
* Both Fantom & Algorand Standard Assets use advanced smart contracts which enable us to automate many features of the platform.
* Algorand features one of the highest transaction throughput rates of all the blockchains, meaning you'll never sit and wonder when your tokens will arrive.
* ETH L2 projects will be our next options
* We will pursue the developments on other cheap tx chains
