# Who legally owns the underlyinng asset?

Token holders legally have ownership of the real world assets. When you purchase tokens in a Sweet Light proect, you are directly buying a membership interest in the individual DAO LLC that owns the equity.

For example, if you purchase 1% of the tokens in a single offering, you would then be entitled to 1% of the economic interests of the asset over time, which may include income from dividend or property value appreciation, or insurance liquidation, or the sale of the property by the owner entity.

You can view the DAO LLC Agreements, Closing documents, insurance policies, and much more for all real world assets by going to the "Documents" tab of any project page, and clicking the available link.
