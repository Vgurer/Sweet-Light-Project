# Will asset tokens be NFTed later?

For the time being Our consultants have plans for NFTed ownership tokens, since they can automate the process of distributing the revenues without the need for staking. But, we think that the market place of NFTs still not mature enough to treat that asset class as membership units, neither the transaction of NFTs are fluent. In case we choose to proceed on that line; we may work on ALGO too. Since, the critical factor for transacting NFTs on a blockchain is low latency in consensually finalizing transactions. That latency is generally referred to as finality. Given that auctions are common time-sensitive events for trading of NFTs, a long delay is obviously ill-suited. Algorand chain is able to keep the finality under 5 seconds which is much shorter compared to 10+ minutes required on other blockchains like Cardano or Ethereum.

We are working with hyperledger experts on this solutions.
