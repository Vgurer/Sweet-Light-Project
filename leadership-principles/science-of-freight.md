# Science of freight

We designed our goals around freight; earning it, processing it, manufacturing vessels to gain from it, keeping fractional ownership of properties tied to freight.

In scientific words; **Transportation Problem (TP)** i.e cost planning for delivering the product from the source to the destination is the only planetary problem for the continuing & secured existence of homo sapiens.

**Initial Basic Feasible Solution (IBFS)** to TP is finding a way out in obtaining an optimal solution.

Freight is born from the **Opportunity** cost. (Opportunity cost is a component of the collective concept of economic cost.)

In numerical terms, the _opportunity cost value_ is nothing but the **difference** between the cost of the desired alternative and the cost of the next best alternative.

**Economic cost** is important for companies because it allows them to determine the best way to use their limited resources and funds.

Every business structure evolved around freight have a **high entry threshold,** heavily regulated environments designed by sovereigns who possessed any bit of power/influence/disruption over the infimal necessity.

Maritime, Aerial, Continental networks of every type of transportation, fueled by freight levels, are impossibly large & complex, **capital heavy ventures for an individual to be in.**&#x20;

We believe that, any future **decentralized society,** deserves to participate to the large and incomparably high, most of the time oligopolistic gains from freight related businesses.
